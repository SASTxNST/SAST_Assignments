A visually immersive space-themed countdown timer built for the SAST Assignment.
This project simulates a real mission-control environment with animated stars, a floating astronaut, and a live countdown to a fictional rocket launch.

Implemented a setInterval loop to update the timer every second.

Calculated remaining time by subtracting the current timestamp from the launch timestamp.

Designed a futuristic UI with neon glow, space colors, and an animated starfield using the <canvas> API.

Added a floating astronaut element to enhance the immersive space experience.

Ensured clean structure, readable code, and smooth visual polish.
